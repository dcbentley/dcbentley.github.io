                <p>I love my family and friends unconditionally. They continue to contribute much to enriching my life, and helping me enrich the lives of others. Life is too short to be a pessimist, so I live with hope and rational optimism.</p>
                <p>The pride and the love I have for my country is deep and wide. Even when I am at odds with those running it, I will still work with them to make this land an even better place.</p>
                <p>I will reduce, reuse, and recycle. Being Green means being a good steward of what we have been given. It is our duty to leave things better than we found them. It is a gift that we can give to those that come behind us.</p>
